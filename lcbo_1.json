A refreshingly crisp finish caps the medium-bodied and flavourful palate. Pair with grilled fish over a bed of rice.", "Josh Cellars is a renowned brand created to celebrate the founder's father. This delicious California Pinot Grigio is a new addition to their range of wines. It's fresh and bright, with flavours of quince, yellow berries backed up by hints of nuts and fresh bread. Sip on its own, or pair with grilled chicken or fish.", "This pinot grigio is a customer favourite, and it's easy to see why. It's pale straw, with inviting aromas of lemon, pear, and apple. The palate offers flavours of apricot, grapefruit and a hint of honey. It's light-bodied and crisp, with a palate-cleansing finish. Pair with mushroom risotto or grilled shrimp.", "19 Crimes wines are defiant by nature, bold and always uncompromising, just like the D-O-double-G! Cali red was created as a collaboration with entertainment icon Snoop Dogg. This red blend exhibits bold and uncompromising dark berry fruit, spice and toasted oak tones, with a powerful yet smooth finish. Pair with bbq meats.", "Easy drinking, refreshing white wine, sourced from vineyards in Canada and around the world. Shows aromas of cantaloupe, yellow berries and pear with a hint of chocolate. Extra dry, medium-bodied with refreshing melon, berries and pear flavours. Perfect for casual sipping or pair with light fare, salads and appetizers.", "The best selling vinho verde worldwide. Pale colour with a light effervescence. Delicate yeasty notes, with lemon/lime, herbal, floral and nutty aromas and flavours. Dry, crisp and fresh with a clean finish. Low in alcohol and quite refreshing. Ideal as an aperitif or paired with light fish or seafood and fresh salads.", "It pours a medium pink colour with an elegant mousse. On the nose, it offers strawberry and raspberry aromas with notes of pastry and a floral lift. The palate is dry and medium-bodied with soft ripe berry flavours and a fresh citrus finish.", "We've heard this Prosecco is a celebrity favourite. That's not surprising because it's distinctive, rich and fresh, with vibrant, satisfying bubbles. From the producer of the top-selling white wine at Vintages, this sparkler over-delivers for the price.", "No wonder this winery is the best in show - it has initiatives that work on rehabilitating surrounding forests in Peele Island. A pale straw wine with a bouquet of red apples, hazelnuts and a hint of vanilla. The body is medium with a balanced and crisp finish. This would match wonderfully with Fettuccine Alfredo.", "Ruffino's original wine, and one of the world's most recognized Tuscan wines. The wine is extra dry, medium-bodied and well-structured. Enjoy aromas and flavours of chestnut, leather, rye bread and red berry fruit, with spicy notes and a touch of pepper.  Serve with wild boar ragu, grilled steak or roasted vegetables.", "This is a wine that hangs its hat on providing a good-quality Cali Cab at an approachable price point. There's a lot to value here: generous ripe dark fruit, toasty oak, nutty and chocolate notes, with a fresh feel. Pair this with rib-eye steak.", "The Hope family, owners of Liberty School, helped transform the 'wild west' of Paso Robles into a wine lover's destination thanks to wines like this rich Cab with its black fruit flavours. A real crowd-pleaser with barbecued fare or a meat-lovers' pizza.", "From the south of the Rh\u00f4ne valley comes this bright summer sipper. It pours a delicate salmon colour followed by aromas that suggest watermelon, fresh bread with floral, red pear and plum notes. These juicy flavours continue on the extra dry palate with hints of melon and red plum, leading to a pleasant finish.", "For more than 140 years, Ruffino has been making quality wines for consumers to enjoy. Their rich history is in everything they produce. Pronounced aromas of fresh-cut lemon, gooseberry and a touch of herbs.

This wine features the beguiling trio of zinfandel, merlot and cabernet sauvignon, with upfront flavours of ripe fig, smoke and dark chocolate supported by plush tannins. Medium to full-bodied, flavourful, it's superb with grilled meat dishes, burgers or a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich.", "No wonder this winery is the best in show - it has initiatives that work on the rehabilitation of surrounding forests in Peele Island. This dark ruby wine delivers aromatics of red berries, fresh currants and toasted oaky notes; dry, and medium-bodied with a full and balanced finish. Try pairing with Chili con carne.", "The McManis family sources fruit for this super-popular Petite Sirah from its own estate vineyards, which are certified sustainable under the Lodi Rules program. The wine is fermented in stainless steel before ageing in a combo of French and American oak. Expect a robust wine overflowing with spicy, earthy dark fruit and toasty toffee notes, and pour with tourti\u00e8re, glazed ham or ribs.", "Wayne Gretzky's success in the wine world the result of hard work, dedication, and teamwork, evident with this intriguing and aromatic sauvignon blanc. Teeming with aromas of white grapefruit and gooseberry, the palate shows classic grassy notes and well-balanced acidity. Pair with basil pesto pasta or spinach quiche.", "Deeply colored, silky, and luscious, with lovely spice and deep flavors that go long on the palate. A fine example of a premium Lodi Zinfandel.  Score - 92. (Anthony Dias Blue, tastingpanelmag.com, Nov./Dec. 2021)", "This unoaked chardonnay a lively one. Expect inviting notes of crisp green apple, lemon, and pear. A medium-bodied and fruity palate leads you to a long-lasting, balanced finish. Pair with pan-fried white fish alongside fluffy rice and seasonable vegetables or serve as an aperitif.", "In Ontario's southwestern edge, Pelee Island Winery enjoys plenty of sunshine during growing season. Expect vibrant aromas and flavours of cedar, dark berries and fruits, with mint, spicy and herbal notes. Medium-bodied and fruity with a dry finish, this is a great match for a charcuterie board with deli meats and cheeses.", "A brilliant wine, the 2016 Chardonnay Sta Rita Hills comes from a handful of top vineyards (Peake Ranch, Zotovich, La Rinconada, etc.) and spent 13 months in 35% new French oak. It boasts a vibrant gold color as well as terrific notes of white flowers, apple blossoms, citrus, and notable salty, mineral-like subtleties. Clean, medium-bodied, fresh, and focused on the palate, with both richness and freshness, drink it over the coming 5-7 years. Maturity 2018-2025. Score - 93. (jebdunnuck.com, Nov. 29, 2018)", "McManis has been family-owned for five generations and is certified sustainable under the Lodi Rules. This super-popular California Chardonnay has the butter and apple flavours that for many define the style, but a lighter touch of oak makes this a more flexible option than many of its peers for food pairing or even for chilling and sipping on its own.", "Big, ripe, and easy-to-love, this red blend combines Zinfandel, Grenache, Malbec and Petite Sirah sourced from sites in Sonoma, Mendocino, Napa, Lodi and Paso Robles. It shows silky blackberry, cherry and spice, with a driving freshness from the racy acidity that makes it exceptionally food-friendly.", "100% Tempranillo. Beautiful and deep Gran Reserva. You can really taste classicism here. It has an elegant texture, well-integrated tannins, lots of complexity and notes of roasted fruits, sweet spices, cigar box, dried herbs and sweet oak. Fresh acidity enlivens the vivid, spicy and impressively long finish.[Will cellar into the early 2030s.] Score - 96. (Decanter World Wine Awards, 2022)", "In the far eastern reaches of Montepulciano, Tenuta Trerose approaches the boundary of Umbria and Lake Trasimeno. The latter takes the edge off the continental climate, giving an extra push of ripeness which shows through in the lush, fleshy fruit in 2019. It's laden with plush red berries yet remains midweight and mouth cleansing. Powdery tannins layer up across the palate, while touches of pepper and violet add dimension. Drinking window: 2022-2029. Score - 91.
